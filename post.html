            <p> I walked into the WeWork tower feeling excited, and ready to learn something new, but what I felt the most was nervousness. I saw a group of girls standing near the door and knew that they were there for the same reason I was. I was shy and felt like it was going to be extremely hard to find friends. The teacher's assistant (ta) from level two took us to the sixth floor and into the room where the magic happened. I walked in and saw everyone walking around and talking. I sat at a table where there were four other girls and we started talking.</p>
            <p>We talked some more, and I realized that there was no reason to be nervous. Everybody was there for the same purpose as me and everyone was meeting new people as well. I was shocked that I had already made a great group of friends on my first day. We were having a great time talking, and then we were called together to huddle in a circle and play some extremely fun improv games. Of course I was hesitant at first, but I started getting really comfortable and really grew to love the games.</p>
            <p>After our circle time, it was time for our class to start. It was August 21, the day of the solar eclipse, and I obviously wasn't the only person who really wanted to see it. The teachers took us all down to the first floor of WeWork tower and we passed the eclipse glasses around so that we all got a chance to see the amazing moment. We went back inside and the teachers continued to introduce us to Ruby. I will always remember on that day that I really realized my passion for computer programming.</p>
